Homeowner: 
(1st time) Oh thank God you're here.
I really messed up.
I tried to contact my grandmother via this ouji board
I wanted to know the combination to her storage unit.
She passed away recently and the funeral was expensive...
But I know she had some first edition Mokepon cards in there.
Unfortunately her name is really similar to that famous anti-gaming activist
who was murdered last year.
So when I tried to get in contact with her, I thought of the wrong face and... well...
Anyway, I have a demon problem now and it's really bringing down my ELO. Can you please help?
- Heavens yes.
	Thank you! Go ahead inside.

- Hell no.
	Very funny. Let me know when you're ready.

(Subsequent times) Are you ready now?
- Yep.
	Great. Please do your best!
	(door unlocks, timer starts, enemies spawn)
- Nope.
	Let me know when you're ready.

Looks like that's all of them. I should go talk to the homeowner.
- Okay.
